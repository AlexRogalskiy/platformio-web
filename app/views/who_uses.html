  <p>
    <b>SmartAnthill</b> is an open IoT system which allows easy control over multiple microcontroller-powered devices, creating a home- or office-wide heterogeneous network out of these devices. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>SmartAnthill</i> system can be pretty much anything: from a system to control railway network model to an office-wide heating control and security system. As an open system, <i>SmartAnthill</i> 
    can integrate together a wide range of devices beginning from embedded development boards and ending with off-the-shelf sensors and actuators. 
    They can be connected via very different communication means - from wired (currently <i>Serial</i>, with <i>CAN bus</i> and <i>Ethernet</i> planned soon) 
    to wireless (currently <i>IEEE 802.15.4</i>, with low-cost <i>RF</i>, <i>Bluetooth Smart</i>, <i>ZigBee</i> and <i>WiFi</i> planned soon).
  </p>

  <p>
    All <i>SmartAnthill</i> devices within a system are controlled from the one place (such as <i>PC</i> or credit-card sized computer <i>Raspberry Pi</i>,
    <i>BeagleBoard</i> or <i>CubieBoard</i>), with an optional access via <i>Internet</i>.

  <p>
    <b>TouchDevelop</b> combines a cross-platform browser-based <i>IDE</i> for the creation of mobile+cloud apps, an online programmer/user community, and an app store.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>TouchDevelop</i> makes learning programming exciting! You can write code directly on any device and you can directly use sensors and media via high-level <i>APIs</i>.
    It's easy to create games and apps, publish them or tweak those published by others. 
    You write code in our touch-friendly editor where you compose programs by tapping on your screen, yet concepts you learn transfer to traditional languages such as <i>Java</i>, <i>C#</i> or <i>Arduino</i>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>TouchDevelop</i> embraces the "Bring Your Own Device" revolution by providing a unified programming environment everywhere.
